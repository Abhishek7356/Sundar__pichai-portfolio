            <h1 class="heading">About</h1>
            <p>Pichai began his career as a materials engineer. Following a short stint at the management consulting
                firm McKinsey & Co., Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation
                efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well
                as being largely responsible for Google Drive. In addition, he went on to oversee the development of
                other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. In 2010, Pichai also announced the open-sourcing of
                the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM. The Chromebook was released
                in 2012. In 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <p>Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015, after previously being appointed
                Product Chief by CEO Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at the completion
                of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company family. He was
                appointed to the Alphabet Board of Directors in 2017.

                Pichai was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2016 and 2020.

            <h2>Career story of Sundar Pichai</h2>
            <div class="box">
                <h1>Had No Room of His Own during Childhood</h1>
                <p>Pichai’s family was from a modest background in Chennai. His father saved for three years to buy
                    their
                    first scooter, and sacrificed a lot more to ensure that Pichai and his brother got the best
                    education
                    they could. The brothers used to sleep in the bedroom which was also their living room. The family
                    used
                    to take the bus or their scooter to travel across town. His father was an electrical engineer and
                    his
                    mother was a stenographer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h1>Got Curious About Engineering and Excelled at IIT Kharagpur</h1>
                <p>Pichai used to listen to his father about the challenges at his work as an electrical engineer, and
                    that
                    eventually got him curious about technology. At the age of 12, he developed an aptitude for numbers
                    when
                    his family bought a telephone. He could remember every number dialled during the day.

                    Pichai excelled at school, and was also the captain of the cricket team in high school. He pursued
                    his
                    B.Tech in Meallurgical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, and then won a scholarship to study material
                    sciences and semiconductor physics from Stanford University.</p>

            <hr>
            <div class="box">
                <h1>Pursued His MSc from Stanford, then Ditched His Plans for a PhD</h1>
                <p>Much of the money that Pichai’s parents had in savings was used to buy his air tickets to Stanford.
                    His
                    degree in material sciences and semiconductor physics, would later on be of groundbreaking use to
                    the
                    developments at Google. In 1997, he dropped the idea of pursuing an an academic career, and decided
                    to
                    drop out of his PhD at Stanford. He then joined Applied Materials, a semiconductor maker in Silicon
                    Valley, as an Engineer and Product Manager, and soon went to pursue his MBA at the Wharton School.

                <h1>Joined McKinsey after MBA; Tried to Talk a Friend out of Joining Google</h1>
                <p>Pichai joined the Wharton School of Business for his MBA, where he was named a Siebel Scholar and a
                    Palmer Scholar. He graduated from Wharton in 2002, to join McKinsey & Company as a management
                    consultant. Pichai realized that moving to Google would be a suitable career move, after trying to
                    convince a McKinsey colleague to avoid that exact thing. Pichai joined Google on April Fools’ Day in
                    2004. Interestingly, it was the same day when Gmail was introduced to the world.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h1>Initial Rejection and Eventual Success of Google Chrome</h1>
                <p>Pichai joined Google as a soft-spoken manager, to work on Google’s search toolbar. The toolbar was
                    made
                    with a goal to give Internet Explorer and Firefox users an easy access to Google search. The
                    toolbar’s
                    success motivated Pichai to think of Google having its own web browser. Eric Schmidt, the then-CEO
                    of
                    Google, thought that it wasn’t worth the cost.

                    However, Pichai had immense belief in the idea and ultimately convinced the founders of Google,
                    Larry
                    Page and Sergey Brin, to launch Google’s own web browser, called Google Chrome. Pichai led the
                    launch of
                    Chrome that went on to become the best web browser in the world, surpassing both Internet Explorer
                    and
                    Firefox. This earned Pichai worldwide recognition in 2008, and he became the Vice President of
                    product
                    development at Google.</p>

                <h1>Passed up Being Twitter’s Head of Product and Microsoft’s Next CEO</h1>
                <p>From 2008 to 2013, Larry Page ensured that Pichai’s rise in Google was rapid. In 2011, Pichai was
                    considered to head product development at Twitter, but he decided to stay with Google. In 2013, when
                    Android creator Andy Rubin left for Google’s robotics project, Pichai was asked to take over Android
                    too. Pichai led the rapid growth of Android’s app ecosystem. In 2014, Pichai almost became the third
                    CEO
                    of Microsoft, but Google managed to retain him.</p>

                <h1>Named as Google’s CEO, with the Birth of Alphabet Inc</h1>
                <p>Pichai was not just a business savvy professional with great technical skills, but an excellent
                    leader
                    and diplomat too. He is known for building strong teams, avoiding office politics, and respecting
                    everyone’s opinion. When Google decided to form its parent company, Alphabet Inc., Sundar Pichai
                    succeeded Larry Page as the CEO of Google. Pichai, the man behind Google Chrome, now heads all
                    products
                    at Google, including Ads, Android, Apps, Maps, Search and YouTube.</p>
